    introducing the concepts of debits, credits, ledgers, and balance sheets. It laid the foundation for modern accounting,
    earning him the title <b>“Father of Accounting.”</b>

  <p><b>Debit</b> ← Debito (Italian) ← Debeo (Latin) → “owed to someone.”</p>
  <p><b>Credit</b> ← Credito (Italian) ← Credo (Latin) → “trust or belief.”</p>
